# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console

If the required dependancies are not installed you can easily run `npm install` which will install the required dependacies with the respective versions that I used on the project

.components -where I chose to place the Navbar and its CSS too
